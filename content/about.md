Hello there! My name is Fernando Eckhardt Valle, and I'm an experienced systems analyst. I work at a research institute with open-source software, specifically with Linux drivers and kernel development.

I'm extremely passionate about Linux and open-source software, and I've spent countless hours studying and experimenting with these technologies. I love the freedom and flexibility that open-source software provides, and I'm always eager to learn more about it.

When I'm not working, you can usually find me tinkering with old video games or programming some stuffs for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. I'm a big fan of retro gaming and love exploring the history of video game development.

Overall, I'm a dedicated professional with a strong interest in technology and a passion for learning (Well... another of my passions is literature, especially Brazilian). I believe that the present and the future of computing is in open-source software, I already contribute to some free software projects like freebsd and qemu, and I'm excited to be a part of this growing movement.

If you want to talk to me, send me an email: phervalle[at]proton.me
